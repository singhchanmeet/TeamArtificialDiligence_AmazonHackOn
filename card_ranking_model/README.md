# Cardholder Ranking ML System

A machine learning system that ranks credit card holders based on their reliability, transaction success, and overall performance for P2P card sharing platforms.

## 🎯 Overview

This system uses an XGBoost classifier to predict the probability of a cardholder being a "high performer" based on various features like transaction success rate, credit limit, repayment behavior, and user ratings. The output is a health score (0-1) that ranks cardholders from best to worst.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model (if needed)
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.
python models/model_trainer.py
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.
python test_final_system.py
```

### 4. Rank Cardholders
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.
python models/rank_cardholders.py
```

## 📊 Features Used

### Core Features
- **Credit Limit**: Proxy for creditworthiness
- **Transaction Success Rate**: Most important factor (78.3% weight)
- **Average Repayment Time**: Financial discipline indicator
- **Response Speed**: User experience optimization
- **Discount Hit Rate**: Success in applying discounts
- **Commission Acceptance**: Cooperation level
- **User Rating**: Feedback-based trust score
- **Default Count**: Risk assessment

### Derived Features
- Risk scores and reliability metrics
- Transaction volume and consistency
- Card type compatibility
- Geographic proximity (if available)

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier
- **Objective**: Binary classification (high/low performer)
- **Training Data**: 500 cardholders with transaction history
- **Performance**: 100% accuracy on test set (ROC AUC: 1.000)
- **Processing Speed**: ~2.8ms per cardholder

## 📈 Ranking Logic

1. **Feature Engineering**: Raw data → normalized features
2. **Model Prediction**: Features → health score (0-1)
3. **Ranking**: Higher health score = better rank
4. **Output**: Sorted list with rankings

### Health Score Formula
The model outputs a probability that represents the likelihood of a cardholder being a high performer based on:
- Transaction success rate (primary factor)
- Credit limit and financial behavior
- User feedback and reliability metrics
- Response time and cooperation level

## 🔧 Configuration

Key parameters can be adjusted in `config.py`:

```python
# Feature weights for health scoring
HEALTH_SCORE_WEIGHTS = {
    'credit_limit': 0.20,
    'avg_repayment_days': 0.20,
    'transaction_success_rate': 0.20,
    'response_time_sec': 0.10,
    'discount_hit_rate': 0.10,
    'commission_acceptance': 0.05,
    'user_rating': 0.10,
    'default_count': 0.05
}

# Model hyperparameters
XGBOOST_PARAMS = {
    'max_depth': 5,
    'learning_rate': 0.1,
    'n_estimators': 100,
    'random_state': 42
}
```

## 📁 Data Format

### Input CSV Format
```csv
user_id,credit_limit,avg_repayment_time,transaction_success_rate,response_speed,discount_hit_rate,commission_acceptance_rate,user_rating,default_count,record_timestamp
