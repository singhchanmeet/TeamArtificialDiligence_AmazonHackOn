## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.true_hybrid_detector import TrueHybridFraudDetector

# Initialize the system
detector = TrueHybridFraudDetector()

# Prepare a transaction
transaction = {
    'user_id': 'USER123',
    'amount': 50000,
    'merchant_category': 'Electronics',
    'city': 'New York',
    'device_type': 'Mobile',
    'payment_method': 'Credit Card',
    'hour_of_day': 3,
    'timestamp': '2025-01-15 03:30:00'
}

# Detect fraud
result = detector.detect_fraud(transaction['user_id'], transaction)

print(f"Risk Level: {result['risk_level']}")
print(f"Risk Score: {result['risk_score']:.3f}")
print(f"Action: {'Block' if result['block_transaction'] else 'Allow'}")
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test on all datasets
python test_hybrid_system.py

# Test on specific datasets
python test_hybrid_system.py --datasets data/test/test_data.csv data/test/test2_data.csv

# Show sample transaction analysis
python test_hybrid_system.py --samples
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Start the API server
python api_server.py

# Use the API client
python api_client_example.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### System Weights
- **ML Weight**: 0.7 (70% influence from ML model)
- **Rule Weight**: 0.3 (30% influence from rule-based system)

### Risk Thresholds
- **Low Risk**: < 0.3 (Allow transaction)
- **Medium Risk**: 0.3 - 0.4 (Review transaction)
- **High Risk**: > 0.4 (Block transaction)

### Rule-based Thresholds
- **High Amount**: $15,000+ during unusual hours (2-5 AM)
- **Very High Amount**: $30,000+ in different city
- **Device Change**: $20,000+ on unusual device
- **Amount Spike**: 5x user's average amount

## 📈 Model Features

### Features Used (18 total)
- **Basic**: amount, hour_of_day, day_of_week, merchant_category, city, payment_method
- **Derived**: amount_log, amount_sqrt, amount_bin
- **Time-based**: is_night, is_weekend, is_business_hours
- **Risk Indicators**: is_high_risk_category, is_high_risk_city, is_high_amount, is_very_high_amount
- **Interaction**: high_amount_high_risk, night_high_amount

## 🔍 System Analysis

### Risk Scoring
The system provides three types of scores:
1. **ML Score**: Probability of fraud from machine learning model
2. **Rule Score**: Risk assessment from rule-based logic
3. **Hybrid Score**: Weighted combination of ML and rule scores

### Decision Logic
- **Block Transaction**: ML score ≥ 0.3 OR rule score ≥ 0.3 OR hybrid score ≥ 0.4
- **Require Verification**: Any score indicates moderate risk
- **Allow Transaction**: All scores below thresholds

## 📊 Performance Tuning

### Improving Recall (Catch More Fraud)
- Lower the hybrid threshold (e.g., 0.3 instead of 0.4)
- Increase ML weight relative to rule weight
- Add more sensitive rules

### Improving Precision (Reduce False Positives)
- Raise the hybrid threshold
- Make rule-based system more conservative
- Require multiple rules to trigger for blocking

### Current Balance
The system is currently tuned for:
- **High Recall**: 56.4% of frauds detected
- **Reasonable Precision**: 24.3% of flagged transactions are actual frauds
- **Good Accuracy**: 68.9% overall accuracy

## 🚨 Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- **Missing Data**: Graceful handling of incomplete transactions
- **Model Failures**: Fallback to rule-based detection
- **Feature Mismatches**: Automatic feature alignment and validation
- **New Users**: Default low-risk assessment for users without history

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All transaction data is validated
- **Model Protection**: Trained models are securely stored
- **API Security**: REST API includes basic authentication
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for audit trails
